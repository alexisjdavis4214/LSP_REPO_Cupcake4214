question 1

prompt:...how you would reorganize or redesign this class to improve its structure?

Answer:
Refactoring Approach:
Split the monolithic class into focused, cohesive classes based on responsibility:

AcademicCalculator - Handle GPA computation and grade-related logic

Method: computeGPA(List<Integer> grades)


RosterExporter - Manage student roster export functionality

Method: exportRosterToCsv(String filename, List<String> names)


EmailService - Handle email generation and communication

Method: makeWelcomeEmail(String studentName)


DateFormatter - Format dates for UI display

Method: formatDateForUi(LocalDate date)


PaymentProcessor - Process tuition payments

Method: processTuitionPayment(String studentId, double amount)


PasswordValidator - Security and password validation

Method: isStrongPassword(String pwd)


CacheManager - Data caching operations

Methods: putCache(String key, String value), getCache(String key)
Field: cache Map



Each refactored class would have high cohesion because its methods work together on related data toward a single responsibility. This approach follows the "behave thyself" heuristic (Heuristic 2.1: "All data should be hidden within its class"), ensuring each class encapsulates its own concerns and collaborates through well-defined interfaces rather than exposing unrelated functionality through a utility class.
